# Restaurant-App
Restaurant App managing orders for food

This Node.js APP is built matching the MVC approach

Technologies in use:
1. Node.js for the backend
2. Express for the middleware
3. Pug as the templating engine
4. Body-parser for transforming content from the view to the model
5. Passport for user authentication
6. MongoDB for the Database
7. Moogoose for connection to the Database
8. Path for accessing the filesystem
9. POSTMAN for testing the API

This App was built up as a self organised hackathon in a class at 
Refactory, Clark International University in Uganda.
